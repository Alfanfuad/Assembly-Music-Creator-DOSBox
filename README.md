# Assembly-Music-Creator-DOSBox
This repository contains a project for creating music using Assembly language with DOSBox. DOSBox emulates the old DOS operating system, known for MS-DOS by Microsoft. This project uses DOSBox to compose and play music, replicating the experience of the 80s with Assembly code and setup instructions.

## Introduction
This project involves creating an instrumental music track of at least 90 seconds using Assembly language, to be simulated on DOSBox. The project is a group effort, and the title of the song can be changed until the deadline. The song title must be unique among all groups.

## Project Requirements
1. **Group Work**: The project is to be completed in groups as per the assigned teams.
2. **Unique Song Title**: Ensure the song title is unique and does not duplicate any other group's title.
3. **Instrumental Track**: The code should produce an instrumental track with a minimum duration of 90 seconds and must include a chorus (reff).
4. **Assembly Language**: The program must be written in Assembly language.
5. **Simulation on DOSBox**: The program should be able to run and be simulated on DOSBox.
6. **Submission Deadlines**: Adhere to all deadlines for song title submission and project submission to avoid penalties.

## Instructions
1. **Song Title and Artist**: Write the name of the song and the artist at the top of the program in the form of a comment.
2. **Writing the Code**: Use Assembly language to write the code for the instrumental track.
3. **Simulation**: Test the program on DOSBox to ensure it runs correctly and produces the intended music.
4. **Group Assessment**: Fill out the group assessment form after completing the project.
